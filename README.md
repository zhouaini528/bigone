### It is recommended that you use the test server first

The official address [API3](https://open.bigonezh.com/docs/authentication.html)

All interface methods are initialized the same as those provided by Bigone. See details [src/api](https://github.com/zhouaini528/bigone-php/tree/master/src/Api)

Most of the interface is now complete, and the user can continue to extend it based on my design, working with me to improve it.
